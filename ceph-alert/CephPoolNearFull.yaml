    annotations:
      description: A pool has exceeded the warning (percent full) threshold, or OSDs
        supporting the pool have reached the NEARFULL threshold. Writes may continue,
        but you are at risk of the pool going read-only if more capacity isn't made
        available. Determine the affected pool with 'ceph df detail', looking at QUOTA
        BYTES and STORED. Increase the pool's quota, or add capacity to the cluster
        first then increase the pool's quota (e.g. ceph osd pool set quota <pool_name>
        max_bytes <bytes>). Also ensure that the balancer is active.
      summary: One or more Ceph pools are nearly full
