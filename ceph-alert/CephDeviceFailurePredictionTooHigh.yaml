      description: The device health module has determined that devices predicted
        to fail can not be remediated automatically, since too many OSDs would be
        removed from the cluster to ensure performance and availabililty. Prevent
        data integrity issues by adding new OSDs so that data may be relocated.
      summary: Too many devices are predicted to fail, unable to resolve
