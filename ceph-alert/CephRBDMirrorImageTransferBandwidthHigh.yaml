      description: Detected a heavy increase in bandwidth for rbd replications (over
        80%) in the last 30 min. This might not be a problem, but it is good to review
        the number of images being replicated simultaneously
      summary: The replication network usage has been increased over 80% in the last
        30 minutes. Review the number of images being replicated. This alert will
        be cleaned automatically after 30 minutes
