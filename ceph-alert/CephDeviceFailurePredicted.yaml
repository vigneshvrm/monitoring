      description: The device health module has determined that one or more devices
        will fail soon. To review device status use 'ceph device ls'. To show a specific
        device use 'ceph device info <dev id>'. Mark the OSD out so that data may
        migrate to other OSDs. Once the OSD has drained, destroy the OSD, replace
        the device, and redeploy the OSD.
      summary: Device(s) predicted to fail soon
